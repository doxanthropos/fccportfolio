          <h3>About Marvin Minsky</h3>
          <p>Minsky was one of the dominating figures of the quest for artificial intellgence for over 50 years and one of the founders of ai research as a scientific field. His works span the range between Mathematics, Computer Science, Cognitive Science and Philosophy and his inventions have been a part of computer history. His life was a big intellectual adventure, inspired by people he met early in his life (like Einstein) and now inspiring to others. With his work, he has won a lot of scientific awards, including the famous Turing Award.</p>

          <h3>Teaching and Writing</h3>
          <p>Marvin Minsky taught at MIT since 1958 until his death in 2016. Some of his lecturs can still be watched on the websites of the MIT and others on Youtube.
          </p>
          <p>The both central books that Minsky wrote are <a href="http://aurellem.org/society-of-mind/" target="_blank">The Society of Mind</a> from 1986 and The Emotion Machine from 2006, where he explains his understanding of consciousness and therefore the possibilites of AI in understandable terms. They are worth a read for anyone interested in either how the mind works or how to build artificial ones.
          <p>In 2008 and 2009 Minsky wrote five essays for the One Laptop per Child project about education and especially the problem of teaching and learning math. These are still available on this MIT website (<a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/OLPC-1.html"
