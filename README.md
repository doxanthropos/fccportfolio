# FCC Portfolio

I am working through the [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.com) curriculum and after developing the first projects on [Codepen.io](http://codepen.io/doxanthropos/#) I decided to use github to store and serve these projects, because I like to develop on my machine and I like to use git.
